## sketches
I am doing a daily sketch in processing.     
The main idea is to to get comfortable enough to support some of my project ideas for [Wekinator](http://www.wekinator.org/) and [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/).

Everything is done in Processing -> (with Processing.js to visualize my sketches in the browser.)
